## background

Wikimedia currently contains 39349 symbolizations about the first degree
of simplification (Verkehrsschrift) of Deutsche Einheitskurzschrift
(DEK) created by user
[Thirunavukkarasye-Raveendran](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Thirunavukkarasye-Raveendran)
(who is not author of this repository). To facilitate self-study
(training to read the short hand, and compare your symbolization with a
reference), 34176 double sided flash cards are assembled in this ongoing
project's Anki deck.

To access the Anki deck, do not download the project, but visit the
release page for the corresponding .zip. Deflated, the Anki deck's
volume only is about 27 MB.
